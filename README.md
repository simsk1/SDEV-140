Project title: Final Project for SDEV 140
Description
The PYthon tkinter program is for a simple GUI that represents the first steps of a food product development process.  The program prompts the user to select a protein, fat and carbohydrate source to use for further refinement in the development of a food product.  The second level windows open with a short list of ingredients displayed as a radio buttons.  The program initializes these variables as intergers so that the radio button is not selelcted when the window is open.  The user can select on item from each of the 3 options shown for a protein, fat or carbohydrate.  The selection is currently not recorded for future use.  That functionality needs to be added.  These ingredient selection windows also have a "Close window" button that is functional.  Clicking that button closes the window and returns the user to the root window.
